Dissipative-Quantum-Field-Theory This is an effort to bring Dissipative Quantum Field Theory based on Nonequilibrium
Thermodynamics to the world in terms of theoretical aspects and stochastic simulation approaches. The main framework
has been developed by Hans Christian Oettinger at ETH. We are going to use Sympy and QuTip for this purpose.
