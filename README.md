Dissipative-Quantum-Field-Theory This is an effort to bring Dissipative Quantum Field Theory based on Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics to the world in terms of theoretical aspects and stochastic simulation approaches. Hans Christian Oettinger has developed the main framework at ETH. We are going to use Sympy and QuTip for this purpose.
